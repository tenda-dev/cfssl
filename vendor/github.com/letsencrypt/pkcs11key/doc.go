package pkcs11key

// This package represents "v2" of the pkcs11key package, which was not
// compatible with Go modules and is now frozen in amber. You should instead
// import github.com/letsencrypt/pkcs11key/v3, which has the same interface but
// will be kept up-to-date and is compatible with Go modules.
